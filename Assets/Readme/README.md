# Seasons
Seasons is a puzzle platformed based around changing the seasons. You play as Agate, a lost rock monster. Change the seasons to navigate the map, collect the orbs, and complete levels.

Seasons was created using Unity Engine and C#. This is a project for the Software Design and Development course (COMP 225) at Macalester College.

## Compatability

## Bugs
* The bounce flower, if ran at while pressing jump on the right frame, will launch the player very high. This is fairly difficult to achieve on accident, though not impossible.
* The player likes to bob its head in the first level.
