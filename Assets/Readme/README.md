# Seasons
Seasons is a puzzle platformed based around changing the seasons. You play as Agate, a lost rock monster. Change the seasons to navigate the map, collect the orbs, and complete levels.

Seasons was created using Unity Engine and C#. This is a project for the Software Design and Development course (COMP 225) at Macalester College.

## Bugs
* Bounce flower, if run at and press jump on the right frame, will launch the player high. This is fairly difficult to achieve on accident, though not impossible.
* The background is a little small. If the player jumps far off the edge, they might see the edge of the background. This is also a little difficult to achieve on accident, but not impossible.
